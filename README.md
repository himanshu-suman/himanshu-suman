### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Himanshu.

I am currently pursuing my master's in computer science from BITS Pilani. I have published a [research paper](http://doi.one/10.1729/Journal.23815) describing a new data-driven approach to validate genuine candidate resumes using machine learning and fuzzy matching. Currently, I am working on a paper which can identify backbone deformities in an individual by analyszing his/her gait using deep learning techniques. I am actively looking for software development oppurunities.
