### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Himanshu.

I am a recent computer science graduate from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, with a Master's in Computer Science. I am currently working as an Engineer in EDG at MathWorks.

I have strong technical skills, including proficiency in C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SQL, MongoDB, etc. I also have a particular interest in deep learning, computer vision, human gait analysis, and activity recognition. I have multiple certifications, including a Big Data Analytics using Spark certificate from EDX and a Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity (PyTorch Scholarship by Meta). I have presented my research titled "Video-based gait analysis for spinal deformity" at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2022) in Tel Aviv, Israel.
