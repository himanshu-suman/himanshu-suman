During my class 12th, I enjoyed listening to the StarTalk podcast, delving into astrophysics and science. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, often shared how all living things are like masterpieces crafted by nature, refined through evolution over time. This sparked my curiosity about the potential of computers to mimic human abilities and create extraordinary things beyond our capabilities.

In one of the StarTalk episodes, Tyson described our existence journey over a calendar year, highlighting how humans came into existence at the very end of the last day and the very last second. This revelation fascinated me, making me ponder the immense efforts over the years to understand our existence, tracing it back to cosmic events and dust. It showcases the human potential to create the necessary tools and technology to go above and beyond in comprehending the cosmos, which once seemed impossible.

The profound impact of technology on our lives is evident in the ability to access insightful content with a simple touch of our fingertips. This ease of reading, listening, watching and interacting exemplifies the evolution that surpasses other advancements. As I contemplate these connections between science, astrophysics, human existence, and technological evolution, I am driven to explore new advances in artificial intelligence. I aspire to accelerate the pace of engineering and contribute to improving billions of lives through Google.

My primary areas of interest lie in deep learning and computer vision. I am fascinated by the remarkable growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its vibrant community over the years. Google has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of AI through groundbreaking contributions. TensorFlow is one such powerful open-source tool I use a lot. 

In my earlier years as a teenager, I experienced severe back pains and injuries and was eventually diagnosed with early Kyphosis. My doctor provided remedies, guiding me on a path to recovery. Once I regained health, I moved on, temporarily forgetting about the ordeal. Upon joining BITS Goa for my master's in computer science, I was challenged to propose an original problem statement. Exploring Generative Neural Networks in the literature, I found exciting topics, but my professor, who engaged in impactful work on Pose-Estimation and Gait-Analysis, sought something equally impactful. Sharing my teenage experience with posture difficulties, we pondered if computer vision and gait analysis could address such medical issues. This led to identifying a novel and open-ended research problem in computer vision literature.

A significant hurdle was the lack of available datasets and limited literature on the problem. We simulated spinal deformities with student volunteers to overcome this, obtaining well-distributed data. We collaborated with medical experts, surgeons, and orthopaedics, and we fine-tuned our simulated data through their guidance and support. Eventually, we tested our model on real patient data through their help.

This research journey culminated in the paper "Video-Based Gait Analysis for Spinal Deformity," co-authored with my professor, Dr. Tamnay Tulsidas Verlekar. The paper postulated that changes in posture due to spinal deformities can be detected by observing people’s gait, providing a more effective classification method for conditions like Kyphosis and Lordosis. Our dataset and findings were open-sourced to contribute to the scientific community. Also, this paper gave me an opportunity to travel to Tel Aviv, Israel, and share my findings at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) - 2022, regarded as one of the most reputed conferences for computer vision.

Even during my bachelor's, I was able to identify and publish one more open-ended research question, which involved addressing the challenges in the recruitment process. The research introduced a data-driven approach to validate a candidate's resume automatically by leveraging social media platforms. The goal was to provide recruiters the time to thoroughly examine promising candidates.

I currently work at MathWorks as an Engineer, primarily collaborating with the Deep Learning Team for Autonomous Vehicles. A significant aspect of my role involves staying abreast of developments in deep learning, computer vision, and sensor fusion techniques. Recently, my focus has been on enhancing 3D object detection methods. During this exploration, I came across a paper titled "OMNI3D: A Large Benchmark and Model for 3D Object Detection in the Wild. " The paper introduces a novel model named "Cube R-CNN", designed to generalize across camera and scene types using a unified approach. This unified approach, a remarkable feature, allows 3D object detection without relying on actual sensor parameters. The paper also presents a fast and precise algorithm for computing the intersection-over-union of 3D boxes, boasting a speed that is 450 times faster than previous solutions. This advancement facilitates efficient evaluation of the extensive OMNI3D dataset, a new benchmark introduced in the paper for 3D object detection tasks. However, a notable weakness of the paper lies in its assumption that the camera intrinsics are known for each image, which may not align with the realism of some scenarios. The paper does not delve into self-calibration techniques or robustness to noisy intrinsics. In my experimentation with the provided code from GitHub, I observed limitations in generalizing 3D objects when the camera was positioned on the dashboard, and the image exhibited a fish-eye distortion. This suggests a potential area for further exploration and improvement in the proposed model.

Google's AI Residency programs are super cool learning spaces where smart people unite to make AI even smarter. I am super excited about the chance to join the Pre-doctoral Researcher Program because it fits just right with what I dream of doing in the world of AI. This program will give me a fantastic boost in exploring my interests and reaching my goals. Being part of Google's AI Residency means I get to dive into the latest and most excellent AI stuff. I will be surrounded by smart minds and get to work on real-world projects, learning tons along the way. The program is not just about theory but also about hands-on, and I will have mentors guiding me. This means I can turn my big ideas into real things, especially in areas like deep learning and computer vision. Plus, Google loves exploring new and tricky questions, and that's precisely what I am into—solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries. So, being in this program will help me grow my skills, work on exciting projects, and bring fresh ideas to the AI table. It's like the perfect recipe for my AI journey!
